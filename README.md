Personal project. The initial version was built on pure Electron. After some time decided to move away from it but keep the frontend on the HTML/CSS/JS stack, as writing something aesthetically pleasing in Fyne is quite a challenge.

will be getting new features sometimes

Stack : 
- Golang
- SQLite / GORM
- Wails
